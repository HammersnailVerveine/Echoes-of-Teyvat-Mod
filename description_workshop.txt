It is played on a custom, handmade map, and removes most existing mechanics from the game, such as most NPCs, items, or access to the player inventory.

[b]Echoes of Teyvat[/b] replaces terraria combat system with its own, replicating the one found in the game Genshin Impact.
Terraria statistics, such as armor and damage are removed, and replaced with a more complete and complex system.
Damage calculations are completely changed to match the ones from the reference game.

In this mod, the player is able to freely [b]swap characters[/b]. Each one comes with a [b]unique element[/b] from a list of 7 (pyro, hydro, electro, cryo, anemo, geo, dendro). 
[i]note : dendro is currently missing[/i].
Each character uses a [b]specific weapon[/b] type (sword, catalyst, bow, polearm or claymore), and comes with 4 unique abilities : 
[*] Normal attack (defaults to left click) : basic attacks of that character, tied to their weapon type
[*] Charged attacks (defaults to right click) : heavy attacks of that character, consumes stamina except for bow characters.
[*] Elemental Skill (defaults to E) : a special ability unique to each character. Has a cooldown, and usually generates energy.
[*] Elemental Burst (defaults to Q) : a character’s “ultimate ability”. Requires energy to be cast.

The mod implements the full [b]Elemental Reactions[/b] system from Genshin impact.
Attacking enemies with a specific element will [b]apply that element to them[/b]. Attack with another element to trigger an [b]Elemental Reaction[/b] and cause special effects, such as freezing (hydro + cryo), triggering explosions (pyro + electro) or shielding yourself (any + geo).
